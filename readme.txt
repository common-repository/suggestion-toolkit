== Description ==

This plugin provides a fast and flexible way to add recommendations of a different kinds on WordPress website pages, almost any place on the website. It provides Gutenberg block, Elementor widget, shortcode, and WordPress widget and allows you to insert suggestions in almost any place on the website.

The main goal of the plugin is the improvement of blog engagement. Usually, each blog contains a series of related posts enclosing certain topics, so readers for sure will be glad to read more than just one post. Readers will be more satisfied and your blog positions in search are going to improve.

At the same time, bloggers can suggest products from their own store WooCommerce, or eBay store. Also, our eBay extension allows us to monetize the blog with the eBay partner program recommending related products inside the blog posts.

Almost every blogger also has one or more YouTube channels and our plugin allows to recommend related YouTube videos inside the blog posts via YouTube extension.

You can find even more extensions available through the "Extensions" section of the plugin configuration. Some of them are free and some are available for a small fee. We constantly add new extensions and improve existing ones.

We encourage you to purchase **premium extensions**, because this supports our work. However, feel free to [suggest features and report bugs](https://erlycoder.com/support/ "Contact Us").

You can review key features of the plugin and features available through the extensions.
